    "# Python Review\n",
    "Welcome! First of all; this document is meant to serve as a complement to your previous knowledge obtained from the khan academy videos not a supplement. Though the notebook will be written to be as clear as possible; some previous programming experience is recommended in order to understand this notebook with greater ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, high-level general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted: This means the code done on Python can be run by the interpreter directly rather than being compiled into machine language code and then executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level: Usually represents how abstracted the syntax is from computer language or how similar it is to natural language (our language). High level means its syntax is very user-friendly (even among high level languages Python is known to have a very friendly syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "General-purpose: It can be used on many applications; from website development to mobile applications (Just because something is general purpose doesn't mean it SHOULD be used on everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short; Python is a programming language that is very easy to learn (due to friendly syntax), simple to run (we have an interpreter) that can allows us to work in various fields and applications due to its versatility (general purpose). Currently; this language is among the top 3 most popular in the world and it owes this position to its open-source status meaning that anyone can contribute to the proyect with their own packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Now we start the review. Variables and basic arithmetic.\n",
    "A variable is a way that data can be stored and referenced in a program; this data can vary greately from variable to variable and it's usually essential for the functioning of the program. For the user of the program that's pretty much it but for the programmer it also provides labels to the data in order to make the code more readable (this is something crucial not just in Python but in any language).

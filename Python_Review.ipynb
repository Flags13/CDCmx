    "# Python Review\n",
    "Welcome! First of all; this document is meant to serve as a complement to your previous knowledge obtained from the khan academy videos not a supplement. Though the notebook will be written to be as clear as possible; some previous programming experience is recommended in order to understand this notebook with greater ease. Before starting with the introduction to Python; we'll go over some of the basic functionalities of Jupyter which will help us during our programming journey this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, high-level general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted: This means the code done on Python can be run by the interpreter directly rather than being compiled into machine language code and then executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level: Usually represents how abstracted the syntax is from computer language or how similar it is to natural language (our language). High level means its syntax is very user-friendly (even among high level languages Python is known to have a very friendly syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "General-purpose: It can be used on many applications; from website development to mobile applications (Just because something is general purpose doesn't mean it SHOULD be used on everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short; Python is a programming language that is very easy to learn (due to friendly syntax), simple to run (we have an interpreter) that can allows us to work in various fields and applications due to its versatility (general purpose). Currently; this language is among the top 3 most popular in the world and it owes this position to its high-level syntax and its open source status; this meaning that everyone can contribute to Python by making new packages to tackle different applications. These may range from solving differential equations and plotting; all the way to a package designed specifically for stock analysis or simulation of chaotic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "So; usually when writing code we use an IDE (Interactive Development Environment). It can range from dedicated Python IDE's like Spyder and Pycharm; to generalist software like Visual Studio Code, Atom and Notepad. These are generally good options to create projects and to code in general; however, this doesn't allow for visualization and long explanations of the code which is where Jupyter comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source project (the plan is for it to remain free) that is based on visualization, interaction and distribution of code in a simple manner. The name Jupyter notebook comes from both the first 3 kernels to be supported (JUlia, PYThon, R) and the notebooks written by Galileo on Jupiter and it gives programmers a way to run code sequentially in cells and add text in between to explain said code. In short; it's an environment that runs Python (or any Kernel of our choosing) continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way Jupyter works is via the creation and modification of cells; the cells' functionalities depend on the type of cell we create which can be either Markdown, Raw Text, Code and Heading (Headings have since been discontinued and are now included in Markdown). If a cell is in the Code format; then any content inside that cell will be treated just like code in an IDE (the language is determined by the Kernel that's currently running). Cells can be inserted or removed by using the buttons in the upper part of the notebook and to run the selected cell we just need to press Ctrl+Enter. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we run a cell in Markdown then we're free to write text as we please; however, the Markdown format allows for basic text formatting along with an assortment of other neat and useful features (headings, bullet lists, number lists, hyperlink inclusion, LaTeX support and image embedding). This allows the user to not only write explanations to certain code snippets; but also to give it nice formatting and making it even more interactive for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save files we first select a name in the upper left corner of the notebook and just press Ctrl+S.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Now we start the review. Variables and basic arithmetic.\n",
    "A variable is a way that data can be stored and referenced in a program; this data can vary greately from variable to variable and it's usually essential for the functioning of the program. For the user of the program that's pretty much it but for the programmer it also provides labels to the data in order to make the code more readable (this is something crucial not just in Python but in any language).

    "### Whitespacing\n",
    "Python along with most programming languages has an official [style  guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) on how code should be structured, variables named and whitespace written. This style guide sets the standard on how code should be written and allows for consistency within the Python community; whitespace is defined as the space left after pressing the space button. There are some cases in which the use of whitespace is very helpful in matters regarding the readibility of your code; however, sometimes it can work against us since too much whitespace can often lead to confusion whilst reading the code. Therefore; we should focus on being consistent and following the style guide."

Fortunately; given that Python isn't a brand new language; people have tackled said issues before and they've made their solutions available to the public via packages. A package is a collection of modules (they can be built into vanilla Python or developed by others) which together aim to solve a problem or series of problems in a given field. In this club we'll actually be using many packages which will help us analyze images; however, not all of them are dedicated purely for imaging, some have a scope outside of images and can be used in a wide array of applications.\n",

Hey there! You're probably someone in the 2019 edition of Clubes de Ciencia MÃ©xico. If so; this is the repository we'll be
using during the Python portion of the Club. For now we only have 3 files and 2 folders.

### img
This folder contains the images used in the Jupyter Notebooks; you do need to download them but you shouldn't modify anything
otherwise the notebooks won't be able to work correctly.

## Bact
This folder contains the E. Coli images to be used in the first alternative of the final project.

## Python_Review
This file contains all the introductory material needed for Python including: A small introduction to the history behind Python,
introduction to variables and types, basic arithmetic and syntax, control flow, advanced data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries) 
and loops.

## Images_Presentation
This file contains the introduction to images in Python and the introduction to machine learning and clustering.

## OpenCV_File
This contains my annotations which I use during the design of the course.

Even if you aren't a student in the Club; feel free to access the material. If you have any questions or corrections feel free to message
me as well.
